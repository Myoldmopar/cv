## Raspberry Pi

Our entire house has become enamored by Raspberry Pi components, specifically the Pico microcontrollers.  We use them to monitor fridge temps, control cosplay costumes, and run chess timers.

## Music

I've always had a fondness for music of all kinds, and am proficient at guitar and bass, can keep a beat on the drum set, and dabble on the piano.  Favorite band: TOOL.
