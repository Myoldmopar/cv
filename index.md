A quick "about me":

- I spend my [work]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link career.md %}) hours managing the building energy simulation software [EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net) for the United States Department of Energy via the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
- I spent my [school]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link school.md %}) years learning everything I could about heat transfer, fluid flow, building energy, and learning how to apply computational methods to solve problems.
- I have been an author on a reasonable amount of [Publications]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link publications.md %}), although I would love to write more if time allowed.
- I am proficient at many [programming languages]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link coding.md %}), but my favorites are Python, C++, Fortran, and LOLCode.
- My [hobbies]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link hobbies.md %}) page is pretty short right now, but I plan to flesh it out a bit soon.
