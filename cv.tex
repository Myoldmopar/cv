\section{Summary}
Engineer and software developer with deep experience in simulation, numerical modeling, and scientific tool development. Skilled in building robust, open-source tools in Python and C++ for domains like ground heat exchanger design, energy systems, and embedded monitoring. Equally comfortable architecting large-scale backend systems, designing efficient data models, or writing low-level hardware interface code. Known for pragmatic solutions, thoughtful software structure, and effective collaboration across disciplines.
