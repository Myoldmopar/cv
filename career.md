- Research Engineer, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, May 2013-Present
  - I'm having a great time leading development efforts on the building simulation tool EnergyPlus for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  Since taking over technical development, I have overseen the conversion of the codebase from Fortran to C++, the open sourcing onto GitHub, the effort to make EnergyPlus a thread-safe library, and written a new API with C and Python bindings for EnergyPlus.  
  - I've contributed to other projects such as the Technology Performance EXchange (TPEX) and the Standard Energy Efficiency Database (SEED)
- Graduate Assistant, Oklahoma State University, January 2006-May 2013
  - Contributed to a complete re-write of the EnergyPlus central plant simulation, including solution algorithms, pump model re-work, and updating component model design.  Developed a generalized horizontal ground heat exchanger model that includes interaction with a basement zone, specifically for use with foundation heat exchangers. Performed experimental measurement and modeling of transport delay phenomena in piping systems. Worked closely with the Center for the Built Environment at University of California, Berkeley, providing simulation support for Underfloor Air Distribution System research with EnergyPlus
- Engineering Consultant, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Fall 2007 & Summer 2009
  - Utilized EnergyPlus to investigate wall constructions for residential applications, including frame walls, solid wood walls, and phase change materials.
- Engineering Intern, Specific Systems, Tulsa, OK, Summer 2005
  - Introduced to design and manufacturing of modular HVAC equipment; Designed and fabricated parts; Performed various mechanical and structural analysis on designs; Aided in the construction of a thermal test chamber
